## 🔍 Key Decisions & Trade-offs

- Followed the assignment requirements strictly, without introducing extra libraries or tools.  
- No major trade-offs were needed, since the provided tech stack (Next.js, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Chart.js) was sufficient to implement all features.  

## ✨ Features Implemented

- **Complete Page:** The entire Product Insights page has been created as per the assignment requirements.  
- **Mock API Integration:** The app serves randomized mock data through API endpoints to simulate real backend responses.  
- **Interactive Charts:** Charts are built with Chart.js and are interactive (hover, tooltips, legends, custom plugins, etc.).
